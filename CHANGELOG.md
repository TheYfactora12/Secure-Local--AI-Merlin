## [Unreleased] — v1.0 Release Candidate

### In Progress
- Clean Mac smoke test (macOS 14+): Docker → `bash install.sh` → `wizard status` → all green
- GitHub Release with signed `.pkg` artifact and `WIZARD-AI-Installer-v4.zip`
- One-line install: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheYfactora12/home-ai-elite/main/install.sh | bash`

---

## [0.8.6] — 2026-05-05

### Packaging
- Replaced package postinstall login `su -` calls with non-login `sudo -u` user execution.
- Removed package `DOCKER_CONFIG` override so Docker Desktop keeps its working context/plugin configuration.

---

## [0.8.5] — 2026-05-05

### Packaging
- Added a package-local `.docker-noauth` config for non-interactive Docker pulls during package postinstall.
- Avoids Docker Desktop credential-helper keychain failures from background package sessions.

---

## [0.8.4] — 2026-05-05

### Packaging
- Fixed package postinstall log ownership so the user-level background core installer can write to `/tmp/homeai-install.log`.
- Added package readiness coverage for postinstall log ownership handoff.

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-05-05

### Launchd
- Changed macOS stack auto-start to run `scripts/start-core.sh` with `HOME_AI_PROFILE=core`.
- Added `tests/launchd-core-smoke.sh` to guard against launchd starting the raw full Compose stack.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-05

### Uninstall
- Added guarded root/package uninstall path with `--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--keep-files`, `--keep-receipt`, and explicit `--remove-data`.
- Docker volumes are preserved by default and removed only when `--remove-data` is supplied.
- `.env` is backed up before install directories are removed.
- Docker Desktop, Homebrew, Ollama, and Ollama models are never removed by the Home AI Elite uninstaller.
- Added `tests/uninstall-smoke.sh` and CI coverage for uninstaller behavior.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-05

### Release Candidate
- Core profile verified on an 8 GB Mac with Docker Desktop and native Ollama.
- `wizard doctor` reports 43 passed, 2 expected low-memory warnings, and 0 failures.
- Core live smoke verifies Dashboard, Open WebUI, LiteLLM, Qdrant, Ollama generation, and LiteLLM routing to local Ollama.
- GitHub CI runs static smoke tests for profiles, memory config, model-pull policy, update/upgrade profile safety, package readiness, signing preflight, release workflow safety, and container image policy.

### Packaging
- Release workflow now builds package artifacts only from tags or manual dispatch.
- Package build is aligned to the laptop-safe core profile and skips model pulls by default.
- Package payload checks reject local secrets, generated certs, package build output, and nested package artifacts.
- Signed/notarized distribution remains held until Developer ID Installer credentials and clean-machine signing tests are available.

### Safety
- Recommended model pulls are opt-in for non-interactive installs.
- Update and upgrade scripts remain profile-aware and avoid starting Docker Ollama accidentally on macOS.
- Floating container image tags are documented in `docs/CONTAINER_IMAGE_POLICY.md` and guarded by CI.
- GitHub workflows now use `actions/checkout@v6`.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-03 🎉 First Clean macOS Smoke Test

> **Milestone:** First end-to-end clean install on macOS with native Ollama.
> All 10 services green. 18 bugs identified, documented, and fixed in a single session.

### 🏆 Verified
- **First clean macOS full-stack install** — all 10 services up and healthy
  - open-webui ✅ · n8n ✅ · litellm ✅ · perplexica-frontend ✅ · perplexica-backend ✅
  - openhands ✅ · searxng ✅ · qdrant ✅ · swarm-dashboard ✅ · watchtower ✅
- Native Ollama (Metal GPU) — no Docker Ollama container on macOS
- Wizard HQ dashboard live at :8888 with task routing log
- Base-tier models pulled successfully (qwen2.5:7b, qwen2.5-coder:7b, deepseek-r1:7b)

### Fixed (BUG-10 / Issue #11)
- `litellm`, `open-webui`, `perplexica-backend` declared `depends_on: ollama` — hung every macOS install because Docker Ollama container is never started on macOS. Patch 4 in `patch_compose_for_macos()` strips this dependency at install time via Python3 YAML surgery. Idempotent, macOS-only.

### Fixed (BUG-11 / Issue #12)
- `wait_for_service` called twice for Ollama — once unconditionally (crashed Linux via `trap ERR`) and once in Docker path on macOS. Each call now wrapped in correct OS guard.

### Fixed (BUG-12 / Issue #13)
- False-positive `.env` key validation — `set_env_key()` triggered insecure-default warning on legitimate generated secrets that contained the word `change`. Regex tightened to exact placeholder match only.

### Fixed (BUG-13 / Issue #14)
- `.bak` files from `sed -i .bak` committed to repo — potential secret leakage. Added `*.bak`, `**/*.bak` to `.gitignore`. All `sed -i .bak` calls now followed by `rm -f *.bak`.

### Fixed (BUG-14 / Issue #15)
- `fail2ban` `/var/log` mount printed Docker Desktop warning on macOS. Added `nocopy` flag to suppress.

### Fixed (BUG-15 / Issue #16)
- `open-webui` same `depends_on: ollama` root cause as BUG-10. Covered by same Patch 4.

### Fixed (BUG-16 / Issue #17)
- `n8n` had no Docker healthcheck — nginx `depends_on: n8n` was unconditional. Added `/healthz` healthcheck to n8n; nginx now waits for `service_healthy`.

### Fixed (BUG-17 / Issue #18)
- No `litellm` config pre-flight — installer hard-stopped on fresh clones if `configs/litellm/config.yaml` was missing. Now auto-copies from `.example` with a warning, never hard-stops.

### Fixed (BUG-18 / Issue #19)
- Bootstrap failure messaging was silent — failures in `scripts/bootstrap.sh` produced no user-visible output. Added explicit error messages, exit codes, and log-to-file on every failure path.

### Fixed (GAP-02)
- Missing `perplexica/config.toml` hard-stopped the installer. Now auto-copies from `.example` or writes a safe inline fallback. Never hard-stops on fresh clone.

### Fixed (ARCH)
- `docker-compose.yml` macOS safety — compose file is now macOS-safe by default without requiring runtime patch. `depends_on: ollama` blocks removed natively. Resolves Issue #20.

### Added
- `docs/CODEX_CONTEXT.md` — master context prompt for drift-free Codex/AI session resume
- `N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false` — added to `.env.example` to prevent n8n cookie block on local `http://` access
- Native Ollama brain cooldown controls in `cli/wizard`
- LiteLLM default aliases now route to installed base-tier models (not hardcoded mid/high tier)
- Wizard HQ dashboard model list aligned to v1.6 base tier
- Validation scripts updated for native macOS Ollama (no Docker Ollama dependency)
- Config examples added for clean-clone test readiness
- ShellCheck SC2155 CI fix — failure report path variable declaration
- Issues #6–#8, #20–#22 filed from roadmap and session findings

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-02

### Security (install.sh v0.4.1)
- **`read -rs` silent input** for all cloud API key prompts — keys never appear on screen or in terminal history
- **Input validation** before any key is written to `.env`: rejects spaces, enforces minimum 8-char length, retries on bad input
- **`chmod 600 .env`** applied immediately on file creation — owner read/write only, no world/group access
- **Expanded insecure-default detection** in `rotate_secret()` — catches new `.env.example` placeholder string
- **`.env.example` hardened** with `⛔ INSECURE DEFAULT` markers, `openssl rand -hex 32` instructions on every required secret, direct URLs for all cloud API key portals
- **Auto-rotates 4 secrets**: `WEBUI_SECRET_KEY`, `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, `N8N_PASSWORD`, `SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY`

### Project
- **5 GitHub Issues created** from ROADMAP.md open items (was 0) — Issues #1–#5
- Issue #1: v1.0 Signed Release (critical)
- Issue #2: `wizard doctor` preflight (high)
- Issue #3: n8n Ollama retry logic (high)
- Issue #4: Qdrant memory schema + session bridge (high)
- Issue #5: Hardware guide + free stack map (medium)
